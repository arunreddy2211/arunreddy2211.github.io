                <h3>Academic Project(Northwestern Polytechnic University)</h3>
                <h4>Mobile Location Services(Android Project)</h4>
                <p>
                    Mobile phones and the Internet have revolutionized the communication and with it the lifestyle of people. An increasing number of mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) allow people to access the Internet where ever they are and whenever they want. From the Internet they can manage profile based on their location and on the other hand mobile can send location to an authorized user if mobile user is busy and enable to pick the call. 
Let us consider the example that authorized user want to call to a device user, if that user is take a dinner in a restaurant and is therefore searching a restaurant in the Internet. A useful approach to change that profile based on the location such as schools, temple & work place. A good choice is the city where the mobile user is (position), the actual time (evening) or a location where user exist. 
The appearance of different technologies such as wireless networks, Internet, Geographical information systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), have introduced a new type of information technology called Mobile Location Services (MLS).<br> 
MLS have two major actions, that is:<br> 
   1. Obtaining the location of user.<br>
   2. Utilizing this information to provide a service.<br> 

   Modules:<br>
   •	Profile Management: Instead of changing the profile manually in mobile phones. It can automatically changes the profile by using the GPS services.<br> 
   •	Automatic Reply: we can get location address, date & time by sending single sms to the authorized person.<br>
   •	Digital Diary: It keeps track of the location of each & every interval of a time and saves the location details on server.<br>
   •	Call Log Registry: In this application we can store and retrieve any number of call logs on server system.<br>


   Roles & Responsibilities:<br>

   •	Involved in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) of the application: Requirement gathering, Design Analysis and Code development.<br>
   •	Designed responsive user interfaces using HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap framework.<br>
   •	Followed Agile Scrum methodology for the development of the application.<br>
   •	Used Active Directory Authentication to provide security to the application.<br>
   •	Has involved in development of back-end business layers using Servlets and JSP.<br>
   •	Built database to maintain the data and that is needed to store the information.<br>

   Environment:  Java, JSP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Eclipse, Android Studio, Apache Tomcat, SqlYog.<br>

                <p>
                    This project involves monitoring of the vital engineering parameters of Argo profiling floats. The Argo floats stores these vital engineering parameters and communicates them to ARGOS constellation of satellites. The engineering parameters need to be continuously monitored so as to maintain the Argo array in Indian Ocean.<br> 
                    Responsibilities:<br>
                     •	Extracted engineering parameters from Argo float technical files.<br>
                     •	Updated engineering parameters into database.<br>
